"""Detailed worked example of making stock market predictions using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

This file is based upon an excellent tutorial by `Thushan Ganegedara which can be found on Datacamp`_. This article
provided a great introduction to the topic, and was more complex than the LSTM example given  in
`medium_article_realtime_predictions.py`. In contrast, this file is not a faithful reproduction of the tutorial, but
rather a more complex example that builds upon the concepts introduced in the tutorial.

This file is intended to be used as a reference for me in the future, and to provide a more comprehensive understanding
of LSTM networks in the context of stock market predictions.

Examples:
    (Any example implementations for this file)::
        
        >>> bar = 1
        >>> foo = bar + 1

Attributes:
    MODULE_LEVEL_VARIABLE1 (int): A module level variable.

Todo:
    * Work through referenced (url) tutorial and implement the code in this file.
